Dose-Weighting Pseudocode

This pseudocode is provided to allow the user to apply dose-weighting according to their existing pipeline. This may be used as a wrapper for any dose-weighting software, or to create a standalone dose-filtering script.

Users favoring single-software pipelines (emClarity, EMAN2, Relion) are advised against implementing their own dose-weighting to avoid incompatibilities in header, mode and/or normalization.



Operate:
1. Define the dose as desired. Our typical options include the product of exposure and dose rate, 2/3 of that product, or a dose calculated by adjusting the pixel size according to the tilt angle.

2. Read in the tilt stack. In Matlab this can be done with dread (Dynamo).

3. Define the order of acquisition for the tilt stack.

4. Assign a dose to each tilt.

5. Define variables and function for dose-weighting. We use the function from the Grigorieff paper cited in the main text.



Iterate through each tilt of the tilt stack:

6. Generate a filter for the tilt's dose. This can be done by multiplying a spatial frequency array by the dose-weighting function, and then resizing the array to match the dimensions of the tilts. 

7. Take the FFT of the tilt, multiply it by the low-pass filter, and perform an inverse transform to recover a dose-filtered tilt in real space.

x. Alternatively, the dose function can be approximated by modifying and applying a low-pass filter in Dynamo.



8. Write the output tilt stack. In Matlab this can be done with dwrite (Dynamo).
