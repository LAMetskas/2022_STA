# 2022_STA

This script repository is designed to assist tomography data processing. The intended audience are users who are comfortable running existing software packages but are looking to either automate the process or improve outputs. The authors accept no responsibility for incorrect results stemming from over-fitting or other processing errors potentially enabled by these methods, or for silent bugs and errors caused by use of versions other than those for which the wrappers and scripts were originally written. All code is supplied as-is under share-and-share-alike licenses as specified in the individual scripts.

These scripts were designed for specific software packages and versions as follows:

Titan Krios (K3 camera) running SerialEM version 3.8;
IMOD v. 4.9.8;
